Angular service for piwik tracking

### Overview

Angular-piwik provides the methods of the piwik javascript tracker for angular projects.  Tracking config and actions can be accessed declaratively as attributes of the ngp-piwik html element, or programmatically using the Piwik angular service.

## Install

### Bower

    # bower install angular-piwik
    
or in your bower.json (auto)

    # bower install --save angular-piwik

or in your bower.json (manual)

    "dependencies": {
      "angular-piwik": "~1.0.0"
      ...
    }

### CDN

Point to the release on Github's CDN - https://cdn.rawgit.com/mike-spainhower/angular-piwik/v1.2.0/dist/angular-piwik.js

### Manual

Grab `angular-piwik.js` from https://github.com/mike-spainhower/angular-piwik/raw/master/dist/angular-piwik.js


## Use

You must add <code>piwik</code> module as a dependency to your app.  For example

    var app = angular.module 'myapp', ['piwik']

The ngp-piwik html element must be added to the page somewhere.  Currently, only one per page is supported (Piwik async tracker limitation).

Add to page:

    <ngp-piwik ngp-set-js-url="<host>/piwik.js" ngp-set-tracker-url="<host>/piwik.php" ngp-set-site-id="<id>"> </ngp-piwik>

Attributes prefixed with <code>ngp-</code> are Piwik Javascript tracker methods, just dash-separated rather than camel cased.  All Piwik tracker methods are supported.

Once this element is present in the page, you may inject the <code>Piwik</code> service into your controllers.  The Piwik service object has all the same methods as the tracker returned by `getTracker` or `getAsyncTracker` on the raw `Piwik` object.

## Errata
